## Chapter 1 Day 2

Quests
1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

Answer
1. Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming.
2. Blockchains are often forced to make trade-offs that prevent them from achieving all 3 aspects:

   - Decentralized: creating a blockchain system that does not rely on a central point of control.
   - Scalable: the ability for a blockchain system to handle an increasingly growing amount of transactions.
   - Secure: the ability of the blockchain system to operate as expected, defend itself from attacks, bugs, and other unforeseen issues.

All Cadence Programming Language Pillars help to improve and advance that 3 aspects in other way, and it is also good, didn`t it?
